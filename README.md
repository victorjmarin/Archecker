# Archecker

As software systems evolve, their architecture tends to diverge from the idealization in the mind of the architects, which can compromise the non-functional requirements of the system. In this project, we have developed \textsc{Archecker}, a tool to help prevent this undesirable effect by detecting unexpected interactions between components. Given a high-level architectural specification and a mapping from components in such architecture to software entities, our tool computes the architectural violations in the system under analysis so that corrective actions can be taken.

Read [Archecker.pdf](https://github.com/victorjmarin/Archecker/blob/master/Archecker.pdf) for documentation.

Take a look at [archecker.JMoneyTest.java](https://github.com/victorjmarin/Archecker/blob/master/src/main/java/archecker/JMoneyTest.java) to see an example on how to run Archecker.
